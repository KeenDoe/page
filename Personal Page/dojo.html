        <p>My name is McKeen Doe II. I am a 22 year old web developer based in the Philadelphia area.
            I will leave my coding progress, what I have learned and whatever else I've decided in the Dojo.

        <p>Hello to future employers and whoever else is taking the time to read this.
            welcome to my Dojo! It's gonna be a fun journey. So as of today I am taking Andrei Neagoie's Frontend carrer path on his personal platform called Zero to Mastery.
            He has great reception online and I have started to go through this course in the past, however now I intend to not only complete this course but many more on my adventure to becoming a web developer.
            I have also gone through and gotten the responsive web dev certificate from free code camp. All this to say I have a bit of experience with intermediate html and css practices. Today for my coding excersize I
            made the structure of my site. It will more than likley look different than what ive put out today but I will make sure to keep a copy of what I came up with today. Hopefully in a few months I can say I have reached my goal of becoming an amazing developer.
            Till next time - Kenji
